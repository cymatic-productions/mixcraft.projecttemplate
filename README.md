# Tips for Development
## Changing Folder of Stored Imported Loops and SFX
* To [change the folder of stored imported loops and sfx](https://forums.acoustica.com/viewtopic.php?t=30022), perform the steps below.
* Navigate to `File` > `Preferences` > `Library` set the `Loop Library Directory` library folder.  
  * _Note_
    * Be careful to choose a writeable location.
    * this setting [may be grayed out](https://forums.acoustica.com/viewtopic.php?t=16456) if you are not running Mixcraft as an administrator

* When you import the files, there's an option to copy them to the library.
* If you don't choose that option, Mixcraft will just look in the original location.
* If you're using Mixcraft 9, make sure you have build 470.
* If you're using Mixcraft 10, make sure you have build 579.
